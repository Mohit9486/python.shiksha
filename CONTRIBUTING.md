## Find the issue 

Fork the repository and create pull request

### For Tips 

Write a detailed article explaining the soultion 

Explain different types of solutions with simple examples and plain english

Here is the sample article 

https://github.com/arungudelli/Python.shiksha/blob/main/content/en/tips/check-substring-in-string_Python.md

https://Python.shiksha/tips/check-substring-in-string_Python/

1. Add a new mark down file `(.md)` file with the issue name, For example `substring-check.md` inside `content/en/tips/` folder.
2. Follow the markup file mentioned above
3. And starting with the problem statement explain the different ways to solve the problem in Python.

### For DSA problems 

**It's not simply writing the programs write the detailed explaination about the soultion, so that it will be helpful to others**

Here is the sample article 

https://github.com/arungudelli/Python.shiksha/blob/main/content/en/problems/string-anagram-Python.md
https://Python.shiksha/problems/string-anagram-Python/

To contribute to DS & algo problems 

1. Add a new mark down file `(.md)` file with the issue name, For example `two-sum-problem.md` inside `content/en/problems/` folder.
2. Start the file with the below HUGO markup 
3. And starting with the problem statement explain the different ways to solve the problem in Python.
4. Starting with brute force method to optimal solution mention time complexity and space complexity if applicable.

Here is the template of the file

## Problem Statment 

## Approach 1 : (like example Brute force)

Algorithm or approach explanation

Use simple english to explain the soultion.

Then write Python code 

Add Time Complexity and Space complexity (if applicable)

## Approach 2: 

Algorithm or approach explanation

Use simple english to explain the soultion.

Then write Python code 

Add Time Complexity and Space complexity (if applicable)

## Summary

Give summary of different approaches and optimal soultion

```

A problem may have multiple approaches try to add different approaches.
